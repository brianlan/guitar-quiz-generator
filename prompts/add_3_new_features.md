I already implemented a single web page guitar fretboard interval practice tool (practice_interval.html). Now I want you to keep all the current functionalities and some more features.

1. memorizes how the user performed (correct or wrong, time elapsed from the quiz show up to the answer submitted) in each of the quiz, so that it can generate a stats for the user.
2. also consider memory curve in the cognitize science and support 'review' feature, which will generate quizzes to let the user to review regularly (spaced Spaced Repetition). It is better to let the user practice again the ones that have been performed worse in the history.
3. add audio playback. when a quiz shows up, play the note of the yellow marker. When the user submitted the answer, play the note of the green marker.

Please create a detailed plan and execute according to the plan step by step.
