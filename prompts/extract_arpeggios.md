Please checkout the picture I uploaded, tell me what you see in this picture.

Yes, there're 19 diagrams. For each diagram, consider it as a 2-dimentional array (or matrix), and extract the position of each note following "from bottom to top, from left to right" order and write down as a list. 

Take R6F1 for instance, you should output [[5, 0], [5, 3], [4, 1], [3, 0], [3, 2]]. 

Now please convert every diagram to such list, and output all of them.
